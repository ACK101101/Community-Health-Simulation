# Community-Health-Simulation

Generate a grid world of agents with different personal attributes that influence their health. 
The agents live in a community with parks, hospitals, and social ties to each other. 
Each agent's health is correlated to their distance to health influencing buildings and the average health of their peer network.
Play around with the model and explore how the health of the population changes over time!
